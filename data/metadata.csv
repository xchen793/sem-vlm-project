Picture 1-SN.jpg,"""A SEM image of polypyrrole (PPy) single-network hydrogel, it showing a highly interconnected, porous morphology composed of aggregated, cauliflower-like PPy nanoparticles. These particles form a 3D network with a hierarchical architecture, offering a large surface area and multiple interstitial voids."""
Picture 2-CN.jpg,"""A SEM image of the PPy–PVA hydrogel, illustrating its phase-separated microstructure. The image reveals two distinct morphological domains: a loosely connected, porous network corresponding to the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix, and embedded nanoparticulate clusters attributed to the PPy phase. The PPy nanoparticles are uniformly distributed and integrated within the PVA network, forming a heterogeneous composite structure. This phase separation behavior indicates successful in situ polymerization of PPy within the preformed PVA hydrogel."""
Picture 3-DN-1.jpg,"""A SEM image of the PPy–PVA double-network hydrogel after 24 hours of immersion. The image demonstrates a densely fused morphology, where the polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticle network is embedded and encapsulated within the PVA matrix. Unlike earlier-stage structures, no apparent porous domains are observed, indicating a highly compact and interpenetrating network. The smooth and continuous morphology reflects the diffusion-driven integration and full fusion between the two networks over time, suggesting strong physical entanglement and compatibility at the micro/nanoscale."""
Picture 4-DN-2.jpg,"""A SEM image of the PPy–PVA double-network hydrogel after 48 hours of immersion. The morphology reveals a more densely fused and homogeneous structure compared to earlier time points. The polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticle network is almost entirely encapsulated within the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix, reflecting an advanced stage of diffusion and network interpenetration. Notably, early signs of a re-emerging porous structure can be observed, suggesting partial phase reorganization or loosening of the PVA matrix as the immersion progresses. This highlights the dynamic nature of the double-network formation and the evolving microstructure over time."""
Picture 5-DN-3.jpg,"""A SEM image of the PPy–PVA double-network hydrogel after 72 hours of immersion. The microstructure reveals a fully fused and interpenetrated network, indicating complete integration between the polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) phases. The PPy nanoparticle network is entirely embedded within the PVA matrix, while the reappearance of porous features suggests a stabilized hybrid morphology. Notably, the formation of elongated, fibrous structures reflects the orientation of the PVA chains, likely guided by the underlying PPy network. This aligned architecture highlights the strong interfacial interactions and structural templating effect of PPy on the PVA network during prolonged immersion."""
